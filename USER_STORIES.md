## User Story 1: Weekly Check-in

### Scenario
Coach is doing Monday morning check-ins with all clients to see who needs attention this week.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "Give me a status update for Brad."

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Brad's project is currently at 0% completion - none of the 6 roadmap items we set up have been completed yet.
>
> The good news: Sales are strong, he's booked solid until May.
>
> The concern: He's carrying £200k in CBILS debt with £5k monthly payments, and he's got 1 project manager handling 8 jobs simultaneously. That's a lot of pressure on one person.
>
> He recently switched to QuickBooks for real-time profitability tracking, which is good for financial visibility. Still using HBXL for estimating.

**Coach:** "From the roadmap we implemented, where is he right now?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Looking at the roadmap, Brad hasn't started any of the 6 items we planned:
>
> 1. Sales optimization - Not started
> 2. HBXL implementation - Still using it, but no optimization work done
> 3. QuickBooks integration - Actually done! ✓
> 4. Debt management strategy - Not addressed yet (still at £5k/month)
> 5. Team structure improvements - Not started (still 1 PM for 8 jobs)
> 6. Working foreman capacity - Not addressed (still 1 foreman for 3 jobs)
>
> So really, only the accounting system is sorted. The other strategic items haven't been tackled yet. Given his sales are strong, I'd suggest we focus on the capacity issue first - that 1 PM managing 8 jobs is a bottleneck that could hurt quality and delivery.

**Coach:** "What are the problems that he could face in the future?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Three major risks I see for Brad:
>
> **1. Capacity Crunch (High Risk)**
> - 1 PM managing 8 jobs is unsustainable
> - As sales continue (booked to May), he'll take on more work
> - Quality will suffer, delays will happen, customer satisfaction drops
> - Recommendation: Hire another PM or split workload before taking new jobs
>
> **2. Cash Flow Pressure (Medium Risk)**
> - £5k/month debt servicing on £200k CBILS
> - If sales slow down or a big job goes sideways, cash gets tight fast
> - Recommendation: Build 3-month cash reserve, accelerate debt paydown when possible
>
> **3. Strategic Drift (Medium Risk)**
> - Strong sales but no roadmap execution
> - He's operating IN the business, not ON it
> - 6 months from now, he'll still have the same structural problems
> - Recommendation: Block time for working ON the business - maybe Friday afternoons for roadmap items
>
> What I'd prioritize: Fix the PM capacity issue first. Everything else cascades from having the right team structure.

## User Story 2: Problem-Solving Session

### Scenario
Coach notices a client hasn't completed tasks and wants to dig into why.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "What's going on with Sarah Mitchell's project?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Sarah's project is stalled - 2% progress with only 1 of 47 tasks completed. But here's what's concerning:
>
> - 12 tasks are overdue
> - 34 tasks still pending
> - Last activity was 3 weeks ago
>
> Looking at the task notes, she was supposed to implement a new CRM system and hired a sales coordinator, but there's been no movement.
>
> This doesn't look like "busy and executing" - this looks like stuck or overwhelmed.

**Coach:** "Has she been active on her tasks lately?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> No, that's the red flag. Last task update was 18 days ago - she marked "Review CRM options" as complete. Since then, radio silence.
>
> Before that, she was active weekly. Something changed 3 weeks ago.
>
> Common patterns I've seen:
> - Big project came in and consumed all her time
> - Analysis paralysis on the CRM decision
> - Personal/family issue
> - Lost confidence in the roadmap
>
> Suggestion: Quick call to check in. "Hey Sarah, noticed the roadmap's been quiet for a few weeks - everything okay? Want to talk through what's blocking progress?"

**Coach:** "What was she working on before she went quiet?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Her last 3 completed tasks (before going quiet):
>
> 1. **"Review CRM options"** - completed 18 days ago
> 2. **"Interview sales coordinator candidates"** - completed 24 days ago
> 3. **"Document current sales process"** - completed 31 days ago
>
> Pattern: She was in heavy research/planning mode (reviewing CRM, interviewing, documenting). Then she stopped.
>
> My guess: She's hit decision fatigue. Too many options, not sure which CRM to pick, interviews didn't find the right person, now she's paralyzed.
>
> Coaching approach: Help her make a decision. "Let's just pick one - worst case you switch later. What are your top 2 CRM options?" Get her moving again.

## User Story 3: Strategic Planning Discussion

### Scenario
Quarterly planning call - coach wants to set priorities for next 90 days.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "Show me Tom Davidson's progress over the last quarter."

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Tom's had a solid quarter. He's at 68% completion (15 of 22 tasks done).
>
> **What he accomplished:**
> - Hired 2 project managers (huge win - team structure improving)
> - Implemented job costing system (financial visibility ✓)
> - Set up weekly pipeline meetings (sales process tightening)
> - Onboarded new estimator (capacity expansion)
> - Launched referral program (marketing diversification)
>
> **What's still pending (7 tasks):**
> - CRM implementation
> - Lead tracking dashboard
> - Sales training for PMs
> - Subcontractor scorecard system
> - Safety protocol updates
> - Website redesign
> - LinkedIn content strategy
>
> Overall: He's executing well on OPERATIONS (team, systems, process) but lagging on SALES/MARKETING infrastructure. The foundation is strong though.

**Coach:** "What should we prioritize for him next quarter?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Given where Tom is, I'd focus on leveraging the strong ops foundation he's built:
>
> **Q2 Priority 1: Sales Infrastructure** (High Impact)
> - CRM implementation (finally!)
> - Lead tracking dashboard
> - Sales training for those 2 new PMs
>
> Why: He's got the team now (2 PMs, new estimator). If they can sell better, revenue scales fast. Right now they're flying blind without CRM/dashboards.
>
> **Q2 Priority 2: Subcontractor Management** (Risk Mitigation)
> - Subcontractor scorecard system
> - Safety protocol updates
>
> Why: As job volume increases (new PMs = more capacity), sub quality becomes critical. One bad sub can tank a job's margin.
>
> **Q2 Deprioritize: Marketing Tactics** (Low Urgency)
> - Website redesign
> - LinkedIn content
>
> Why: His referral program is working, sales are good. These are "nice to have" but won't move the needle like CRM + lead tracking will.
>
> Recommendation: 3-month roadmap = CRM (month 1), Sales training (month 2), Sub scorecards (month 3). Realistic and high-impact.

## User Story 4: Crisis/Urgent Issue

### Scenario
Client texts coach about a major problem - coach needs quick context.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "Pull up Marcus Webb - he just texted me about cash flow issues."

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Marcus Webb - here's his current situation:
>
> **Financial Position:**
> - Project at 23% completion (8 of 35 tasks done)
> - Has notes about "tight margins on City Hall project"
> - Last update 2 days ago: "Delayed payment from Riverside Development"
>
> **Open Tasks Related to Cash:**
> - "Set up progress billing system" - OVERDUE by 12 days
> - "Renegotiate payment terms with suppliers" - OVERDUE by 8 days
> - "Build cash reserve target" - Not started
> - "Implement job costing" - In progress
>
> **Red Flags:**
> - He's behind on the exact tasks that would prevent cash flow issues
> - Delayed payment + no progress billing = cash crunch
> - No cash reserve built up
>
> **Quick Context for Your Call:**
> He knew this was coming (we had it on the roadmap) but didn't execute on the billing system. Now he's stuck waiting for payment with bills due.
>
> Immediate action: Help him get that progress billing system set up THIS WEEK so future jobs don't create this problem.

**Coach:** "What commitments did he make last month?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Looking at tasks assigned/updated in the last 30 days:
>
> **Completed (3):**
> ✓ "Meet with accountant about job costing"
> ✓ "Review Q1 financials"
> ✓ "Update estimate template"
>
> **Committed but NOT done (5):**
> ✗ "Set up progress billing system" - Now 12 days overdue
> ✗ "Renegotiate supplier payment terms" - Now 8 days overdue
> ✗ "Implement WIP reporting" - Not started
> ✗ "Create cash flow forecast" - Not started
> ✗ "Build emergency cash reserve" - Not started
>
> Pattern: He did the EASY stuff (meetings, reviews, templates) but avoided the HARD stuff (billing systems, negotiations, reserves).
>
> This is classic avoidance behavior - he knew cash would be tight but didn't do the uncomfortable work to prevent it.
>
> Your coaching angle: "Marcus, we saw this coming. You did the planning but not the execution. Let's get the billing system done this week - I'll help you. What's blocking you from setting it up?"

## User Story 5: Pattern Recognition Across Clients

### Scenario
Coach wants to identify trends across all clients to improve coaching approach.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "Which of my clients are falling behind on their roadmaps?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Looking at completion rates across all clients:
>
> **At Risk (< 20% completion):**
> - Brad Goodridge - 0% (0 of 6 tasks)
> - Sarah Mitchell - 2% (1 of 47 tasks)
> - David Park - 15% (3 of 20 tasks)
>
> **Struggling (20-40%):**
> - Marcus Webb - 23% (8 of 35 tasks)
> - Lisa Chen - 31% (9 of 29 tasks)
>
> **On Track (40-70%):**
> - Tom Davidson - 68% (15 of 22 tasks)
> - Rachel Adams - 54% (12 of 22 tasks)
>
> **Crushing It (> 70%):**
> - Mike Johnson - 91% (20 of 22 tasks)
>
> Common thread among "At Risk" group: They all have strong sales but weak execution on systems/process work. They're busy running jobs but not building the business infrastructure.
>
> Recommendation: Group coaching call on "Working ON vs IN Your Business" - they need permission to slow down on sales and invest in systems.

**Coach:** "What's the common pattern with clients who aren't completing tasks?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Analyzing the 5 clients under 40% completion, here are the patterns:
>
> **Pattern 1: Task Avoidance (4 of 5 clients)**
> - They complete "research" and "review" tasks (easy, no commitment)
> - They avoid "implement" and "build" tasks (hard, requires change)
> - Example: Sarah completed "Review CRM options" but won't pick one and implement
>
> **Pattern 2: Overdue Task Clustering (3 of 5 clients)**
> - They don't have 1-2 overdue tasks, they have 8-12
> - Once they fall behind, they give up and stop looking at the roadmap
> - Overwhelm leads to avoidance
>
> **Pattern 3: No Accountability Structure (5 of 5 clients)**
> - None of them have task due dates set
> - No weekly check-ins scheduled in Asana
> - No consequences for not completing
>
> **Your Coaching Fix:**
> 1. Bi-weekly 15-min accountability calls (not monthly hour-long calls)
> 2. Pick ONE task for next 2 weeks, not a whole roadmap
> 3. Make them text you when it's done
> 4. Celebrate small wins to build momentum
>
> The roadmap overwhelm is killing them. Simplify to one task at a time.

## User Story 6: Preparation for Client Call

### Scenario
Coach has a call with a client in 10 minutes and needs to get up to speed.

### Conversation Flow

**Coach:** "Quick brief on Rachel Adams - I have a call with her in 10 minutes."

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> **Rachel Adams - Quick Brief**
>
> **Current Status:** 54% complete (12 of 22 tasks) - On Track
>
> **Recent Wins (Last 2 Weeks):**
> - Hired operations manager ✓
> - Launched new safety program ✓
> - Completed Q1 financial review ✓
>
> **Current Focus:**
> - Working on estimating software implementation
> - Interviewing for sales coordinator role
>
> **What She'll Probably Ask About:**
> - Estimating software - she's stuck between PlanSwift and Stack
> - Sales coordinator - interviewed 3 people, can't decide
>
> **Overdue Items (Gentle Nudge):**
> - Website update (8 days overdue)
> - Marketing plan (5 days overdue)
>
> **Talking Points:**
> - Celebrate the ops manager hire - that was a big commitment
> - Help her decide on estimating software (recommend PlanSwift for construction, faster learning curve)
> - Push her to decide on sales coordinator - "hired gun beats perfect fit 6 months from now"
> - Website can wait, marketing plan matters more
>
> **Her Pattern:** She's a "researcher" - loves analyzing options. Coach her to make faster decisions and iterate rather than perfect-then-launch.

**Coach:** "What did we commit to on our last call?"

**AI Response (GOOD):**
> Looking at tasks created/updated around your last call (2 weeks ago, April 15th):
>
> **Rachel Committed To:**
> 1. "Decide on estimating software by April 20th" - MISSED (still deciding)
> 2. "Make offer to operations manager by April 18th" - DONE ✓ (hired!)
> 3. "Draft marketing plan by April 22nd" - OVERDUE (not done)
> 4. "Schedule sales coordinator interviews" - DONE ✓ (3 interviews completed)
>
> **Score: 2 of 4 completed**
>
> **Call Strategy:**
> - START with wins: "Rachel, you hired the ops manager - that's huge! And you got 3 sales coordinator interviews done. Great momentum."
> - THEN address misses: "The estimating software and marketing plan didn't get done though. What got in the way?"
> - RESET commitments: "Let's make ONE commitment for the next 2 weeks. Pick the estimating software. Done. Which one?"
>
> Don't let her leave this call without making a decision on the estimating software - she's been researching for 3 weeks.

## Key Themes Across All User Stories

### What Coaches Need from AI Responses:

1. **Context, Not Just Data**
   - Don't dump stats - explain what they mean
   - Highlight patterns and trends
   - Connect dots between different pieces of information

2. **Actionable Insights**
   - "Here's what I see" + "Here's what I'd do about it"
   - Specific recommendations, not generic advice
   - Prioritization (what matters most right now)

3. **Coaching Angles**
   - How to frame the conversation with the client
   - What questions to ask
   - What commitments to get

4. **Human Understanding**
   - Recognize behavior patterns (avoidance, overwhelm, analysis paralysis)
   - Empathy for why clients struggle
   - Realistic expectations

5. **Quick and Conversational**
   - Coach is busy - get to the point
   - Natural language, not corporate speak
   - Anticipate follow-up questions

### Response Style Guidelines:

**DO:**
- Use coaching language: "I'd suggest...", "My guess is...", "Pattern I see..."
- Give specific examples from the data
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Acknowledge wins before addressing problems
- Provide "talk track" suggestions for client conversations

**DON'T:**
- Dump formatted tables/stats
- Use corporate jargon
- Hedge everything with "it could be" or "maybe"
- Give 10 options - give 1-2 strong recommendations
- Ignore the human/emotional side of business coaching

## Testing Criteria

When testing conversational AI responses, ask:

1. **Would a real coach find this helpful?** (Not just technically correct)
2. **Could the coach use this response in a client call?** (Practical application)
3. **Does it sound like an experienced construction business coach?** (Tone/expertise)
4. **Does it answer the actual question asked?** (Not what we THINK they asked)
5. **Would this response lead to better client outcomes?** (Real value)

If the answer to any of these is "no," the response needs work.
